															<span>About this Book</span>
													</div>
													<p>The book details Trevor Noah's experiences growing up in Johannesburg, South Africa during the apartheid era. Noah's parents were a white Swiss-German father and a black Xhosa mother; at the time of Trevor Noah's birth in 1984, their interracial relationship was illegal under the Immorality Act. According to Noah, "for [him] to be born as a mixed-race baby" was to be "born a crime."[1] Interracial relations were decriminalised when the Immorality Act was amended in 1985. As a mixed-race person, Noah was classified as a "Coloured" in accordance to the apartheid system of racial classification. Noah was raised primarily by his mother and her family in Soweto.</p>
