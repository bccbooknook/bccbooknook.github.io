													</div>
													<p>Nari knows the rumors about Arrowood. Forbidden magic. Illegal crossbreeding. Strange howls in the night. Should she go through with the wedding anyway?

As Nari rides toward Arrowood and her new home, her head is elsewhere. Soon, she will be marrying the clan chief's handsome son.

Their rites of binding must go off without a hitch. Every detail of the ceremony needs to demonstrate unity between the two rival clans, as Nari of Tanglewood weds Mordahn of Arrowood.

Nari hears the sound of horses' hooves pounding the trail up ahead and frowns. Why is her fiancé riding out to greet her, here in this isolated stretch of road, wearing chainmail and bearing arms?

**The events in this standalone novella occur 50 years before Lady Apprentice and provide a great introduction to the series!**
